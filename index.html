      <h2>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="#">Wounded2WebDev</a></strong>.</h2>
      <p>
        Father, Husband, Wounded Warrior, Web Developer. I believe that our disabled/wounded Veterans are the biggest untapped resource in this country. Turning a hobby of 30+ personal sites developed into a business, my goal is to tap into that
        resource to build incredible websites for very happy clients. More than a web development company, Wounded2WebDev is an opportunity for those who sacrificed to serve again.

        <h3>Web Development & Design</h3>
        <p class="skill-web-p">
          Web Development & Design offers a unique opportunity to combine two of my passions, helping Veterans and building amazing websites. Military culture develops detail-oriented problem solvers who can tackle any challenge. What does this mean
          for you? Wonderful websites built right.

        <h3>App Development</h3>
        <p class="skill-app-p">
          Having an app is a key part of business in 2020. However, many apps feel disjointed from their website and even the company. Having both developed under one roof not only makes for a better user experience, it also saves time and money.
